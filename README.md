##Chien's Profile Admin Page
I made this project to manage [my profile](https://chiendezign.info).

To run the project, you need to connect it to the backend. The backend source code for this page is on [this repo](https://github.com/puppylet/chien-profile).

Assume that you already have the backend, do the following steps to run it on your local

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/puppylet/chien-profile.git`
2. Go to the project directory `cd chien-profile`
3. Install the dependencies `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Open the `src/config.js` file to change the API URL if needed
5. Run the project `npm start` or `yarn start`
6. Have fun!
